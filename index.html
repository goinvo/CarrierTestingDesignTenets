				<div class="overview content-chunk">
					<p>
						Genetic carrier testing results are complicated. The average person
						doesn't have the genetic knowledge to understand exactly what their
						results mean, and what they are supposed to do with them. In fact,
						the results are generally too complex for even their doctors to
						interpret.<br><br>
						This framework is a proposed set of design standards for delivering
						carrier testing results in a way that patients and clinicians can
						feel both a sense of understanding and empowerment.
					</p>

				<div id="reports" class="example-container content-chunk">
					<h2>Report Examples</h2>
					<p>
						Carrier testing reports will look different depending on who is
						being tested, and where they are in the process. The following
						report examples assume that one individual, whether they currently
						have a partner or not, has given a sample to be tested as a carrier
						for a panel of diseases.
					</p>
					<ul class="example-list">

									<h3>Marisa</h3>
									<p>
										After deciding to have a baby,
										Marisa chose to include carrier testing in her pre-conception
										check-up. She tested as unlikely to be a carrier for any
										diseases on the panel.

							A crucial and dynamic aspect of the carrier testing report is that
							it incorporates the two sets of results once both partners, or both
							the partner and donor, have been tested. The reports below include
							combined results for two individuals. (Coming Soon)

					<h3 class="research-title">Ecosystem Analysis</h3>
					<p class="research-description">
						As part of the initial stages of the design process, we launched a significant effort
						to understand the ecosystem of carrier testing services. This included conducting
						scientific literature research, as well as outlining the customer experience, feature
						set, and value propositions for the top competitors in the industry to understand what
						opportunity gaps exist.
					</p>

					<h3 class="research-title">Expert Contextual Inquiry</h3>
					<p class="research-description">
						Through our connections with local medical institutions and clinicians,
						as well as a guerilla effort to acquire more industry experts through
						social media and survey tools, we conducted exploratory interviews to understand the
						ecosystem and problem set. These efforts were two-fold. On the patient
						side, we aimed to understand the customer journey of carrier testing for
						patients or prospective parents. On the clinician side, we hoped to
						outline the workflow of OBGYNs, pediatricians, genetic counselors, and
						any other clinicians involed in carrier testing.
					</p>

					<h3 class="research-title">Usability Testing</h3>
					<p id="multiorgs" class="research-description">
						After translating insights gathered from literature and exploratory primary
						research into version one for multiple projects, we then approached
						our interview subjects again to obtain valuable feedback on designs. For
						all projects involved, this was an iterative process. User feedback was used
						to evolve designs, which were used to gather more feedback, and so on. We
						employed the use of few "champion" users, whom we contacted frequently for
						shorter cycles of feedback and iteration.
					</p>

					<h3 class="research-title">Industry Experience</h3>
					<p class="research-description">
						As a software design consultancy, we have worked with Mt. Sinai Hospital and
						two other leading genomics organizations to design the digital experience for a variety
						of genetic testing products. Our one-on-one engagements with some of the top professionals
						in the industry have provided essential feedback on clinical feasibility and scientific accuracy.

					<h2>Design Limitations</h2>
					<p>
						While this framework accommodates the most common types of autosomal recessive carrier results,
						it is important to note that not ALL results are currently accommodated.
						Below are important limitations in the report capabilities.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Report sample  patient and disease content is synthetic and is not
							intended for use.</li>
						<li>X-linked disease carrier status not supported.</li>
						<li>Non-autosomal recessive disease carrier status is not supported.</li>
						<li>Care team permissions design is to be determined.</li>
