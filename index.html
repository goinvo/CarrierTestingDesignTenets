				<h1>Beth, you are a carrier for 3 diseases</h1>
				<h2>Being a carrier is common and does not mean you have the disease.
					<br>Each child's risk is undetermined until we test your partner.</h2>
				<div class="card-container">
					<ul>
						<li>Cystic Fibrosis</li>
						<li>Usher Syndrome Type 1 (USH1)</li>
						<li>GJB2 Related hearing loss</li>

				<p>You are unlikely to be a carrier for the 197 other diseases tested.</p>
				<h1>To know your children's risk, have your partner tested</h1>
				<p>Until we know if your partner is a carrier for the same diseases as you, the risk to your children is undetermined.</p>

				<p class="bold">Why should my partner BE tested?</p>
				<p>Some parents want to know their children's chance of inheriting a disease so that, if needed, they can:</p>
				<ul class="test-considerations">
					<li>Take precautionary measures during pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Prepare for a child with disease before birth</li>
					<li>Alter family plans.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bold">Why should my partner NOT BE tested?</p>
				<p>Some parents do not want to know if they are a carrier of a disease, or want to wait until birth to know if their child has inherited any disease.</p>
