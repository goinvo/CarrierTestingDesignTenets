				<p>Some parents want to know their children's chance of inheriting a disease so that, if needed, they can:</p>

					<li>Take precautionary measures during pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Prepare for a child with disease before birth</li>
					<li>Alter family plans.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Why should my partner NOT BE tested?</h2>
				<p>Some parents do not want to know if they are a carrier of a disease, or want to wait until birth to know if their child has inherited any disease.</p>

				<h2>Send your report to your family doctor</h2>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<p>This test is not able to guarantee your children will or will not inherit a disease but rather provide awareness to the likelihood of a child having a disease tested for.
