				<h1>Beth, you are a carrier for 3 diseases</h1>
				<h2>Being a carrier is common and does not mean you have the disease.
					<br>Each child's risk of inheriting a disease is undetermined until we test your partner.</h2>

				<div class="card-container">
					<ul>
						<li><div class="card-item"><p>Cystic Fibrosis</p>
						<p>Characterized by impaired lung and digestive function due to thick, sticky mucus. The disease typically worsens over time and currently has no cure.</p></div></li>

				<h1>To know your children's risk, have your partner tested</h1>
				<p>Until we know if your partner is a carrier for the same diseases as you, the risk to your children is undetermined.</p>
				<div class="placeholder"></div>
				<h3>Why should my partner BE tested?</h3>
				<p>Some parents want to know their children's chance of inheriting a disease so that, if needed, they can:</p>
				<ul class="test-considerations">
					<li>Take precautionary measures during pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Prepare for a child with disease before birth</li>
					<li>Alter family plans.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Why should my partner NOT BE tested?</h3>
				<p>Some parents do not want to know if they are a carrier of a disease, or want to wait until birth to know if their child has inherited any disease.</p>

				<div class="button">
					<p>Request partner's test</p>
				</div>

				<div class="line"></div>

					<h3>Send your report to your family doctor</h3>
