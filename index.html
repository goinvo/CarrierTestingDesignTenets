				<h1>Beth, you are a carrier for three diseases</h1>
				<h2 class="subheader">Being a carrier is common and does not mean you have the disease.
					<br>Each child's risk of inheriting a disease is undetermined until we test your partner.</h2>

				<div class="card-container">
					<ul>
						<li><div class="card-item"><a href="#"><p>Cystic Fibrosis</p></a>
						<p>Characterized by impaired lung and digestive function due to thick, sticky mucus. The disease typically worsens over time and currently has no cure.</p></div></li>
						<li><div class="card-item"><a href="#"><p>Usher Syndrome Type 1 (USH1)</p></a><p>Presents with com­plete hear­ing loss from birth, prob­lems with bal­ance and pro­gres­sive loss of sight start­ing be­fore pu­ber­ty.</p></div></li>
						<li><div class="card-item"><a href="#"><p>GJB2 Related hearing loss</p></a><p>Hearing loss that varies from mild to profound, is typically present at birth, and does not worsen over time.</p></div></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>You are unlikely to be a carrier for the <a href="#">197 other diseases tested</a>.</p>

				<div class="line"></div>

				<h2>To know your children's risk:</h2>

				<a href="#"><div class="button">
					<p>Request partner's test</p>
				</div></a>

				<p>Until we know if your partner is a carrier for the same diseases as you, the risk to your children is undetermined.</p>
				<div class="card-container">
					<div class="risk-container">
						<h2>If your partner IS NOT a carrier:</h2>
						<p>Each child is unlikely to have the disease.</p>
						<img class="graph" src="/img/graph-noncarrier.png">
						<p>There is still less than a 1% chance you and your partner could be a carrier as we cannot test for all possible variants of the disease.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="divider"></div>

					<div class="risk-container">
						<h2>If your partner IS a carrier:</h2>
						<p>Each child has a 25% chance of having the disease and a 75% chance of not having the disease.</p>
						<img class="graph" src="/img/graph-carrier.png">
						<p>The odds of your partner being a carrier depend on the disease, family history, and ethnicity.</p>

				<h2>Why should my partner BE tested?</h2>
				<p>Some parents want to know their children's chance of inheriting a disease so that, if needed, they can:</p>
				<ul class="bullet-list">
					<li>Take precautionary measures during pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Prepare for a child with disease before birth</li>
					<li>Alter family plans.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Why should my partner NOT BE tested?</h2>
				<p>Some parents do not want to know if they are a carrier of a disease, or want to wait until birth to know if their child has inherited any disease.</p>

				<div class="line"></div>

				<h2>Send your report to your family doctor</h2>
				<p>If you have siblings, they have 50% chance of being a carrier of the same diseases as you. Some siblings appreciate knowing this information, but some do not.
				<a href="#">Consider these reasons before telling family.</a></p>

				<a href="#"><div class="button">
					<p>Choose people receive your report</p>
				</div></a>

				<p>(You'll be able to choose which information to send)</p>

				<div class="line"></div>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<p>This test is not able to guarantee your children will or will not inherit a disease but rather provide awareness to the likelihood of a child having a disease tested for.
					<br><a href="#">Read the limitations</a> of this test to understand what is and is not covered.</p>
