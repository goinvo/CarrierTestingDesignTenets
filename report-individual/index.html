								<h2>If your partner IS NOT a carrier:</h2>

								<p>The odds of your partner being a carrier depend on the disease, family history, and ethnicity.</p>

						<h2>Why should my partner BE tested?</h2>
						<p>Some parents want to know their children's chance of inheriting a disease so that, if needed, they can:</p>
						<ul class="bullet-list">
							<li>Take precautionary measures during pregnancy.</li>
							<li>Prepare for a child with disease before birth</li>
							<li>Alter family plans.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Why should my partner NOT BE tested?</h2>
						<p>Some parents do not want to know if they are a carrier of a disease, or want to wait until birth to know if their child has inherited any disease.</p>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<p>This test is not able to guarantee your children will or will not inherit a disease but rather provide awareness to the likelihood of a child having a disease tested for.
					<br><a href="#">Read the limitations</a> of this test to understand what is and is not covered.</p>
